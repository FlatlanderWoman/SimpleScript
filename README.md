# SimpleScript: Interpreted Programming Language

Interpreted programming language built with Python. 
Docs and releases are served through GitHub. 
It's turing complete and is simple to use.
It is based on the BASIC programming language, and features error highlighting, variables, functions, etc.
The language is simple to use yet robust enough to support the creation of actual programs.

## Installation

Ensure Python 3 is installed on your system. SimpleScript does not use any external libraries.
This makes it entirely portable since it does not require the installation of any third-party libraries.

## How To Use

You can use Python to launch the interactive shell. This will allow you to play with the SimpleSCript language in your terminal. You can use the shell to test expressions. 
In your BASH terminal, run the `shell.py` script using Python. 

```BASH
python shell.py  # Launches the interactive SimpleScript shell
```
